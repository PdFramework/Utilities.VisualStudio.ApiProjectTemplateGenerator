# Utilities.VisualStudio.ApiProjectTemplateGenerator

This project and it's branches were created to demonstrate the process I went through to create a Multi-Project Template for use in Visual Studio.

**DISCLAIMER**: *While the final project is a complete workable solution, cloning it and trying to utilize it as is, won't work at the moment as it references a number of NuGet packages that currently reside on a private NuGet feed. I am working on fixing this.*

In the meantime, please feel free to utilize this as a reference for how to get started creating your own Visual Studio project templates. You can also look at the [series of blog posts](http://www.peinearydevelopment.com/visual-studio-templating-the-goal/) I wrote around the creation of this project.

Please feel free to create an issue around any egregious errors or leave a comment/question on the related blog posts.
